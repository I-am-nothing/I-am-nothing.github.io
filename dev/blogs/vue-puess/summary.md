## Summary

&emsp; Since I have always wanted to build my blog

&emsp; But because of competitions and other things I want to learn, I can't spend too much time studying the web

&emsp; Later, I found that the junior used the [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) architecture after
    
&emsp; I found that the page looks good, and I can quickly build my blog

&emsp; More importantly, just write [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) documents and compile them into static web pages

&emsp; very convenient

## Introduction

&emsp; > [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) < is a static web page generation tool based on node.js

&emsp; Can convert [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) documents to static web pages

&emsp; They are commonly used in technical document writing, personal blog production, etc.

&emsp; And the environment development is perfect

&emsp; There are many [Theme](https://github.com/topics/vuepress-theme) and [Plugin](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/zh/plugin/) on the Internet that can use it

## How To Start
