## 3D Maker Club
&emsp;&emsp;This is a club that I joined the first semester in my first grade of senior high. Here, I learned laser cut and 3D print. Those help me make side-project and models a lot.

&emsp;&emsp;First time I through Adobe Illustrator to draw a charm and used laser-cut cutting some patterns. Like the left-hand side picture. I laser cut two words. These two words reverse it and have different meanings. "Challange" and "Victory". What an exciting thing.

&emsp;&emsp;The lower left corner is the model made by [Security_Smart_Home](https://github.com/I-am-nothing/Security_Smart_Home)<font size="2">([<span style="color:#007bff">&nbsp;.docx</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhFzi2feWOz2Gax-PqmswtHTDt-eyBC42QOLEBsT-FA/edit?usp=sharing)[<span style="color:#e69138">.ppt</span>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CLF7nTyfLZ677lPc1mkNgJW-RC2V5mb7DHh6XexCC1A/edit?usp=sharing))</font> There were many problems encountered, such as assembling the 3D model, and the thickness of the board was often one more or less than the thickness of the panel. We didn't want to waste boards. So we slowly grind off the excess places<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;For the door (lock) of this model, we designed a revolving door and did not use screws, created a hole on the top and bottom, and put a shaft through the door into these two holes.

&emsp;&emsp;The picture in the upper right corner is the [Security_Smart_Home_2nd](https://github.com/I-am-nothing/Security_Smart_Home_2nd) <font size="2">([<span style="color:#007bff">&nbsp;.docx</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pIwP28cPY0j0kTdAGPogLw7TcMTjWPokIr8tGELqfSE/edit?usp=sharing))</font>'s IOT device, Improving the design of first-generation and integrating into small cube. In the future, We can draw a PCB Diagram to make them smaller.

## Elite Club

&emsp;&emsp;This is a community where the skilled elite communicates with each other. Most are also self-learning. Such as the development of system design, Mobile Applications Development, and microprocessors.
