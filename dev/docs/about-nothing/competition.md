## The 51st National Skills Competition, Middle Division,<br/>-- [IT Software Solutions For Business](https://github.com/TcivsCSE/51A-Data)
&emsp;&emsp;This was my first off-campus competition in senior high school. With some tips from seniors and self-learning. Although not smooth to learn. But as long as you understand it, subsequent learning and development would become very efficient. Thus, I got second place in this competition.

## The 51st National Skills Competition,<br/>-- IT Software Solutions For Business
&emsp;&emsp;After winning second place in the last competition, I was going to participate in the national competition. This time we have to design a complete "Shanghai transportation system" and complete it within four days. Through repeated practice and design, Bringing the optimized code to competition, For four consecutive days and eight hours is exhausting.

## The 51st National Skills Competition,<br/>-- [Mobile Applications Development](https://github.com/I-am-nothing/VA_CARE)
&emsp;&emsp;This was my last competition in senior school. Due to usually developing applications, "Mobile Applications Development" was not that difficult for me. But this competition has an elimination match. Unfortunately, I was too nervous and lost my essential game. I felt very upset. This also taught me that I shouldn't take it lightly during the competition, but also ease my emotions and avoid being affected by tension.

## 2021 National Senior High School Side Project Competition,<br/>-- Group Of Electrons
&emsp;&emsp;This was my first large system design [side-project](https://github.com/I-am-nothing/Security_Smart_Home), from database and web applications to mobile applications and microchips. First of all, I wanted to finish it by myself. But I need to think about many layers of issues and functions. That led me not to be efficient. Therefore, I invited my classmates to be my teammates. Communication and dividing the work make this project better and better.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;We have successfully won the favor of school teachers. Thus, after we had sorted out the topics more fully, we participated in the semi-finals and got excellent work.

## 2022 Annual Intramural Side Project Competition,<br/>-- Group Of Electrons
&emsp;&emsp;The following year, I participated in the [side-project production competition](https://github.com/I-am-nothing/Twitch_Car)again. Still different from last year, I brought two students unfamiliar with programming to complete this project. It was a challenge for me. At first, I wanted them to learn more challenging techniques, such as laser cutting, mike ohm wheel, and motor with Hall-Rotary encoder. Still, the time problem of exams in the third year of high school, we use a relatively simple DC motor. Although this is the case, I teach them how to build the program modularly so it can be better debugged and read.
