## Computer Hardware Decoration Grade C
&emsp;&emsp;In this test, I learned how to install the computer operating system and disassemble it so that when I need a computer later, I can buy and assemble it according to my needs.

## Computer Hardware Decoration Grade B
&emsp;&emsp;In this test, we need to learn to solder, write programs and set up servers. Because I often research circuits, I need frequent soldering. Therefore, I will share these experiences with my classmates and demonstrate them to them so they can quickly learn this skill.

## Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
&emsp;&emsp;This is a skill taught by a first-year senior health teacher. Through the dummy, we are familiar with the actual operation and can effectively make the most appropriate response in the face of an emergency.

## APCS Concept Level 4, Coding Level 3
&emsp;&emsp;Because the middle school often touches on building block programs and has a particular foundation, I can learn faster when writing programs in high school. During the summer vacation of the first and second year of high school, I participated in the APCS test and got the concept of level 4 and the implementation of level 3. The score is a good grade, but for me, there are still many algorithms that I haven't learned yet, and I will continue to learn more algorithms to optimize the efficiency of my program and solve a problem faster.
